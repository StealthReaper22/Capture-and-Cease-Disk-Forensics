# Capture-and-Cease-Disk-Forensics
This project simulates a disk forensics investigation using Autopsy and FTK Imager. The goal is to recover deleted image files from a suspect disk image, verify integrity through hashing, and document findings in a formal forensic report. Tools used include Autopsy, FTK Imager, and hash verification utilities.
